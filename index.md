# Welcome to <%- ctx.name_of_app %>

It supports markdown with ejs embedded, so you don't have to repeat<% for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i) { %> yourself<% } %>.

Feel free to modify it. It is not designed as a comprehensive framework, but instead as a starting point where personal, private, local websites can build from.
